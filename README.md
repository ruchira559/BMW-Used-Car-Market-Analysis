# BMW Used Car Market Analysis 🚗

## Overview
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the BMW used car market. The project aims to understand how various factors—such as model, mileage, year of manufacture, and fuel type—influence the resale price of BMW vehicles.

## Files in Repository
* **`BMW_EDA.ipynb`**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization.
* **`bmw_used_car_market_analysis.csv`**: The dataset used for the analysis, containing 10,781 rows of data.

## Key Insights
* **Most Popular Models:** The 3 Series and 1 Series dominate the used market volume.
* **Price Drivers:** Mileage is the strongest predictor of price, showing a non-linear decay.
* **Fuel Trends:** Diesel vehicles still make up a significant portion of the market, though Hybrids command a higher average price.
* **Efficiency:** Average MPG has seen a slight decline in newer (2019-2020) models, likely due to a shift in testing standards (WLTP) or consumer preference for larger engines/SUVs.

## Libraries Used
* Pandas (Data Manipulation)
* Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)
* NumPy (Statistical Computing)

## How to Run
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Ensure you have the required libraries installed (`pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib`).
